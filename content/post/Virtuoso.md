## Ruler in Virtuoso XL/L
- Press 'k' for creating a ruler and 'Shift+k' for deleting all.
- After pressing 'k' do right click (RMB) to show the options. Turn on the "Smart snapping off" if you want to create multi segment rules.
{{< figure  library="true" src="post_virtuoso/ruler_rmb.JPG" title="Ruler RMB menu"  numbered="true" lightbox-group="header" >}}
{{< figure  library="true" src="post_virtuoso/ruler_options.JPG" title="Ruler options" numbered="true" lightbox-group="header" >}}

- For multi-segment ruler, start normally. Use 'Shift + LMB' for creating a point and now you can continue in an orthogonal direction.
